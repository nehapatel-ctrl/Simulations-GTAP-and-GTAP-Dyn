# Global Economic Impacts of Trade Policy Shocks Using GTAP and GTAP-Dyn Models

This repository contains the research project titled **"Global Economic Impacts of Trade Policy Shocks Using GTAP and GTAP-Dyn Models"**, which evaluates the effects of strategic trade policy changes involving major global economies such as India, China, the US, the UK, the EU, CPTPP, and RCEP members. The study models various scenarios including free trade agreements, tariff reforms, and geopolitical tensions such as Trump-era tariffs and the Indo-Pak conflict.

Using **GTAP-Static** and **GTAP-Dynamic (GTAP-Dyn)** computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, the research simulates the impact of India joining CPTPP and RCEP, and other countries entering new trade partnerships. Custom shock files were developed using **RunGTAP** and **RunDYN** tools based on the April 2023 GTAP v7 data release, allowing detailed analysis of policy effects over time. The project also incorporated gravity-model-based calibrations to estimate the influence of **tariff** and **non-tariff barriers (NTBs)** across multiple regions and sectors.

Key findings show that India could experience **real GDP gains of up to 2.4%**, with notable improvements in the pharmaceutical, services, and manufacturing sectors. Additionally, the study identifies significant export growth potential in textiles, automobiles, and electronics under CPTPP accession, driven primarily by tariff eliminations. All simulations and results are backed by rigorous model validation and sector-level calibration.

The project contributes valuable insights for trade economists and policy analysts exploring the global consequences of shifting trade alliances and tariffs.
